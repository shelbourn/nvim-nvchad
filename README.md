# Nvim Config VCS [👷‍♂️🚧 WIP 🚧👷‍♀️]
Forked from [NvChad starter repo](https://github.com/NvChad/starter)https://github.com/NvChad/starter

_### IMPORTANT NOTE _

- The base branch for customizations is `develop`
- `main` is a clean branch for syncing changes with the upstream fork
- Normal development workflow:
    - add config changes to `develop` or a feature branch based on `develop`
    - sync upstream fork changes into `main`
    - PR `main` to `develop` to back merge the synced changes
    - This keeps `main` clean and without merge conflicts when a fork sync is necessary
    - This also allows for maintaining a custom config branch with the most recent upstream changes
